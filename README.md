<h2>Change file permissions</h2>

- The file project_m.txt is a restricted file and should not be readable or writable by the group or other; only the user should have these permissions on this file.
- List the contents and permissions of the current directory and check if the group has read or write permissions.
- Which says read only
- Use the chmod command to change permissions of the project_m.txt file so that the group doesn’t have read or write permissions.
